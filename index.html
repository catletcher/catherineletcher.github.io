            <h2>I'm excited to share a little bit about myself 
            with you through this website.</h2> <br>
        <section>I am from Davis, California and have lived there 
            all my life until being accepted into Gonzaga. As a second year, I am majoring in Business and 
            minoring in Digital Marketing. Marketing is the study that I want to continue working in. Now, 
            I live in a dormitory on campus. I currently live in a suite style dorm with one roomate and 
            two suitemates. I am living with 3 of my friends. My roomates names are Rachel, Greta, and 
            MacKenzie. These same friends will be my roomates in a house next year that we have signed 
            the lease for. We will be living in the Logan neighborhood, the neighborhood surrounding Gonzaga, 
            and we are very excited to live together again. </section>

        <section>I have always been involved in choir because of my love for music 
            since I was young. I started choir in a middle school choir and continued 
            to sing in high school where I took on jobs and tasks to help out.
            Now in college, I am in my second year of choir, finding my footing, and 
            I am a section leader for the choir I am in, Gonzaga's Musea. As a section 
            leader I help our choir direction with tasks delegated to me and the other 
            section leaders. I am so glad I am getting involved in my choir because 
            I have been singing since I can remember. </section> <br>
        <section>One of my favorite songs is: Bags by Clairo </section>
